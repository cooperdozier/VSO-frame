# VSO-frame

live preview of mobile-first responsive improved presentation slide deck. unclear if i wrote any of the index.html with some generator but definitely not the sensory definition bit https://cooperdozier.github.io/VSO-frame/index.html

A responsive and mobile-ready web-based presentation template

Note: the index.html is presently still put together like a template. In order for everything to work correctly, open any file in the /pages directory instead.
